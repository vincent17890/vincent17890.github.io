I am a PhD candidate in Marketing at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley.

My research focuses on how language and memory shape consumer behavior, leveraging interdisciplinary methodologies including natural language processing, machine learning, and behavioral studies. So far I have explored questions such as: How can we measure the evolving consumer perception of brands when the descriptors themselves are also changing in meaning? How does similarity between source and targets affect consumer spending? Does false memory of product attributes affect consumer evaluation of products and other downstream decisions?

Previously, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from National Taiwan University.
