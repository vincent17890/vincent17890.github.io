### Job Market Paper
**“How brand perception (really) changes over time: Decomposing real from nominal changes using time-aware natural language processing”** **Vincent Chen**, Ming Hsu, and Zhihao Zhang - Under review at *Journal of Marketing Research*

Consumer perceptions of brands are rarely static. Consequently, successful branding demands timely and accurate tracking of the evolving dynamics of how consumers perceive brands. While measuring brand perception has long been a standard practice for marketers, a less recognized challenge of brand tracking is that the language describing attributes of brands—such as how Social a brand is—can itself change over time. In this paper, we propose the need to introduce a conceptual distinction between real and nominal measures of brand perception changes, as the latter can deviate substantially from the former due to changes in attribute meanings over time. Specifically, we develop a data-driven approach to dissociate real from nominal perception by accounting for changes in attribute meanings. We do so by leveraging time-aware natural language processing (NLP) models and brand tracking data covering 20 years between 2001 and 2020 to extract attribute meanings over time from contemporaneous longitudinal text corpora. We further present evidence supporting the validity of our decomposition using a combination of behavioral and NLP approaches. Taken together, this work expands the ability of researchers and practitioners to capture changes in brand perception over time and provides a theoretical foundation for understanding their managerial implications.

**"Spread and control of medical rumors in a social network: A generalized diffusion model with a highly asymmetric network structure"** Chen‐Nan Liao, Ying‐Ju Chen, and **Vincent Chen**. *Production and Operations Management* (2023)

Medical rumors have become a threat to modern society. To study the spread and control of rumors, nonlinear differential equations modeling with the well‐mixed assumption is commonly used. However, this approach ignores the underlying network structure which plays an important role in information spreading. We establish a generalized differential equations model to study the spread and control of medical rumors in a highly asymmetric social network. In our model, each node represents a group of people and a “weighted” and “directed” network describes the communications between these nodes. This network can be generated from real‐world data by community detection algorithms. We provide methods to numerically calculate the final size of a rumor in each node and its derivatives with respect to each parameter. With these methods, if the government has resources to influence the parameters subject to certain constraints or cost functions, one can obtain the optimal resources allocation easily through nonlinear programming algorithms. We show that the implications on the government's resources allocation from the well‐mixed special case in the literature or conventional wisdom may become inapplicable in the general situation. Therefore, the underlying network should not be ignored. Because the final size of a medical rumor is not always the best measure of its damage, we extend our results to a wide class of objectives and show that different objectives result in very different implications. While the lack of a rule of thumb may sound negative, our flexible framework provides a powerful workhorse for interested parties to work out the details in their specific situations. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for no outbreak of rumors. This condition can serve as a heuristic that a government with abundant resources can use to prevent the outbreak of rumors.

### Work in Progress
**“Windfall, similarity, and mental accounting”** with Ellen Evers *Working Paper*

Windfall effects, well documented in the marketing and economics literature, challenge 
the assumption of fungibility of money by showing that people spend money differently depending on its source. However, little is known about the factors driving this phenomenon; two different theoretical perspectives make diverging predictions of spending in response to different windfalls. We conceptualize mental accounts as spending-categories and demonstrate that higher similarity between windfall sources and targets boosts purchase intentions. To avoid circular reasoning when explaining category formation using human-rated similarity, we utilize semantic similarity measured by word embedding models.
